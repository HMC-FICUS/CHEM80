# CHEM80
Material from the predecessor of CHEM80 @ HMC

These notebooks come from a trial version of "Computing for Chemsitry"/"Numerical Methods for the Central Science" - they aren't a complete course yet! They also likely have errors! Use with caution.

These notebooks are setup to run in Google Colab, and as such, have some Colab specific syntax ('Drive Mounting', etc.).
