The camera's software (e.g BioRad ImageLab) quantifies the intensity of each band and allows us to compare the relative amounts of material (e.g. the fraction of DNA that has been cut at a specific location by an enzyme).  I've attached a sample.  \n","\n","Behold the sample!\n","\n","![Example image from Prof. Haushalter showing a gel with rectangles of various shades of grey.

The technique applies and electric field to the gel to cause the molecules to move through it. Smaller or more charged molecules move through the gel faster than larger or less charged molecules (and end up further down the gel).\n","\n","Here's my hand-wavy explanation as to how it's done (Prof. Haushalter can tell me how wrong I am!):\n","\n","1. Preparation of the Gel: The first step in gel electrophoresis is to prepare the gel, which is the medium through which the molecules will move. Depending on the type of macromolecule being separated, different types of gels may be used. Sometimes you'll see things like \"Polyacrylamide electrophoresis\", which tells you the gel used was Polyacrylamide.\n","\n","2. Loading of the Sample: The sample containing the mixture of molecules is loaded into wells in the gel.\n","\n","3. Application of an Electric Field: An electric field is applied once the sample is loaded. The macromolecules will start moving based on their size and charge. DNA and RNA carry a negative charge (I think?) and thus move toward the positive end of the field.\n","\n","4. Separation of the Molecules: As the molecules move through the gel, they will separate based on size and shape. Smaller molecules will move faster and travel further through the gel, while larger molecules will move slower and not travel as far.\n","\n","5. Visualization: After a certain period, the electric field is removed, and the separation of the molecules is visualized. This is often done using stains or dyes that bind to the macromolecules and can floresce under UV light (and be seen by a special camera!).\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"c_JGm4nLNjDs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Paper reading time!\n","\n","Open up the link to the class paper notes [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BY2KcwaBKU78y2et_xvpmZCOYYMQ_a7avm7PFVJ_EDE/edit?usp=sharing).\n","\n","To ground yourself in what the paper is about, everyone should read the **Abstract** (it has two sections!), the **Introduction**, and the **Conclusions**.
