The basic idea is as follows:\n","\n","1. Pick the region of the atmosphere we're interested in that is relevant for our compound of interest. Is our volume an entire city? A few metres? The whole Earth? This is non-trivial, as I'll mention below.\n","\n","2. Assume the volume is well-mixed (no concentration gradients). This means you have to pick a box small enough that this is true for the compounds you're interested in.\n","\n","3. Assume any relevant processes happen uniformly within the box.\n","\n","Then, define the sources (inputs/inflows) into the box and the sinks (outputs/outflows). Examples of sources can be direct emissions (ex. cars emit $NO$), advection (ex. wind blows sea salt to shore), or chemical reactions within the box itself (ex. $O_3$ is formed chemically, not emitted).\n","\n","Sinks can be things like deposition (ex. particles or molecules are 'dry deposited' when they settle on a surface and don't re-enter the air - 'wet deposition' is rain, so things can also be rained out), chemical reactions (ex. a pollutant like benzene can be removed by chemical transformation through reaction with an oxidant), advection again (things can blow away).\n","\n","We can do our best to represent all of these processes in mechanistic models where we essentially solve this equation:\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\frac{d[X]}{dt}=\n","+ Emission+Advection+Chemistry+Deposition\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","$Emissions$ and $Deposition$ are included in models through empirical parameterizations (equations built from data and a bit of mechanistic insight).  The spatial scale of the model determines how $Advection$ is handled - models with \"physics engines\" or \"dynamic cores\" can solve for advection deterministically (wind is simulated with PDEs) but in some models it's included as an empirical parameterization. $Chemistry$ is included by writing the relevant reactions as a system of ordinary differential equations and solving them numerically. I'm leaving out for now what is often called \"mixing\" - essentially how models handle turbulent mixing, which is very scale dependent (and always some form of parameterization). The treatment of turbulence in models helps inform how vertical transport works (we don't need this right now).\n","\n","This box model approach scales to pretty much all scales (including the entire Earth), because even though we can't assume large areas are well simulated by a single box, we *can* assume several boxes all stacked on-top and next to each other can represent that kind of space. All we need to do then is describe the exchange between boxes (typically advection or \"mixing\" based).\n","\n","![0D vs 1D vs 3D models (it's all boxes): http://kavassalis.space/s/SlideMd.png](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/61ae9885d7103a326c42a062/t/6208923f6d10ea045a8986bb/1644728895510/SlideMd.png)\n","\n","So, understanding the basic way a 0-D box model works is important because not only does it serve as our heuristic for thinking about how atmospheric change occurs, but because it's also the fundamental building block of sophisticated chemical transport models (a model that solves a big system of coupled ODEs representing atmospheric chemistry coupled with things to appropriately move the air around <- I am being vague with \"things\" (I teach other courses on this though!)).\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TxnnsEdTvGbc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# How do we model chemistry for a big system like the atmosphere?\n","\n","1.

Advection. This can be a source or sink as wind can blow pollutants into or out of the region we're interested in. Understanding how this impacts air quality depends in a big way on the chemical lifetime of the compounds we're trying to understand. If we are focused on very short-lived chemical compounds (things that will really quickly react or deposit on a surface), we may not care much about advection. If we are focused on longer-lived compounds, then horizontal transport could become really important. Air quality chemistry involves extremely short-lived and  long-lived compounds, so advection is certainly important, but there are situations where the pollutants we're interested in are entirely locally produced and wind plays a minor role in regulating their concentrations.\n","\n","2. Deposition is an important sink for many key pollutants. Ozone is readily taken up by plants, for example, and ozone concentrations are strongly impacted by the ability for vegetation to remove it from the air. In the stratosphere, deposition onto particles is very important! All surfaces have some ability to 'dry deposit' pollutants.\n","\n","3. Emissions are essential for primary pollutants - these are compounds emitted directly from a source, like many volatile organic compounds, NO, carbon monoxide, some types of aerosols. Secondary pollutants are only formed through chemical reactions (things like ozone, secondary organic aerosols) and have no emissions (but are obviously still dependent on them).\n","\n","4. Vertical transport. This is distinct from advection (which is horizontal transport, where the rate of removal - or addition - of a pollutant is a function of horizontal wind speed). Vertical transport can occur through large convective updrafts (think the feeling in the air that happens when a storm is forming) or through turbulent transport. These processes are mathematically represented in very different ways (and vertical transport is much more problematic to get right in models than advection) but are essential for many kinds of simulations."],"metadata":{"id":"D1OuI9DzvwxR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Stratospheric Ozone\n","\n","Since stratospheric chemistry is sometimes in the Mudd core, this will hopefully be somewhat familar (but I am going to go over it again).

This isn't close at all! There are several reasons why our Chapman-only model would over-predict stratospheric ozone. The first one being that the Chapman mechanism doesn't contain all of the relevant reactions that occur in the stratosphere. The natural <b>catalytic destruction</b> of ozone by hydrogen oxide radicals ($HO_x$) and nitrogen oxides ($NO_x$) has been neglected. We have also not included catalytic destruction due to chlorine and bromine radicals. Ozone gets made through different chemistry near the surface (and we've ignored that). Transport is also important in the lower levels of our model, so pretending the layers of the model are only dictated by local chemistry and no vertical mixing isn't especially realistic. Plus, the surface chemistry that the linked paper above deals with is entirely missing here. The gas-phase reactions that are missing are easy to add and will improve this simulation a lot. By only including a portion of the chemical production and loss terms (and none of the other terms talked about at the top of the notebook), we aren't going to make a great model.\n","\n","Okay, so, our model might be \"wrong\" if we don't include all the relevant processes, *but* this very simplified picture was *enough* to predict the *existence* of an ozone layer and get the height it should form roughly correct in the first place. That's practically worth part of a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1995/summary/\">Nobel prize</a>!\n","\n","While a lot of our understanding of this chemistry comes from the 1970s-1990s, there are still aspects of the chemical mechanism we are refinining. This is how cool papers still get published on this topic. The basic thing you need is: know the elementary steps of the reactions you think are happening, have some rate constants to try, and solve a big system of ODEs then compare it with observations to see if we did better than what came before.
