Installing what? I thought Colab came with everything we needed! Well... not everything. While Colab has many popular libraries pre-installed, we sometimes find ourselves needing to install things above and beyond what the Colab Python image offers. A reminder, a library is a collection of pre-written code modules that you can use to simplify your coding process. These modules or packages include a variety of pre-written functions, classes, etc. that allow us to perform many tasks without writing exhaustive code ourselves. Libraries help save time and effort by providing ready solutions to common programming tasks. Some of the most commonly used Python libraries that you have potentially used before are:\n","\n","1. **NumPy**: NumPy, short for 'Numerical Python', is the fundamental package for numerical computation in Python. It provides support for arrays (including multidimensional arrays), as well as functions for mathematical operations such as linear algebra, random number generation, Fourier transform, and more.\n","\n","2. **Pandas**: This library is useful for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data, including functionalities for manipulating tables, time series manipulation, and data aggregation.\n","\n","3. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a plotting library. It allows you to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python, offering an interface that mimics MatLab's graphical plotting.\n","\n","These are already here and we don't need to install them. When we do need to do installs, we can do it directly into the notebook using install statements, typically leveraging the package manager `pip`.\n","\n","Any library installed directly in a notebook will only be available within that specific notebook session. When you end the runtime (with free Colab accounts, this happens every time you close the notebook), you lose whatever you have installed (so you have to run your installs and imports each time). This has some advantages though (when you are working with many libraries, sometimes they don't play nice together and you can break stuff - when working with libraries locally, using Docker or a conda environment is strongly recommended. Colab is our virtual environment, so we don't have to worry about breaking things).\n"],"metadata":{"id":"14QRp0aZ8GRp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Executing Install Statements\n","\n","To install a new package in a notebook, preface the usual pip install command with an exclamation mark (!).

This is important when your notebook requires a specific version of a library. Google Colab periodically updates versions for standard libraries too, so sometimes functionality of code will change and you may want to go back to a specific library version. Sometimes libraries have careful dependencies and they require specific versions to play nice together.

This can make code easier to read but may cause confusion with local variables (don't name an object in the notebook `path` then!).\n","\n","3. **Importing everything from a module** (e.g., `from os import *`): This is discouraged as it can clutter the namespace, making it unclear what's imported and where certain symbols come from.
