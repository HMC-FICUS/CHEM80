The Metropolis algorithm, this extremely general method that is used in things like pseudo-random number generators, numerical integration schemes, and finding minimal paths through complex surfaces, comes from a chemistry paper. Nicholas Metropolis and colleagues published a paper in the Journal of Chemical Physics in 1953 called \"Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines\" (\"Fast Computing Machines\" - adorable... They were talking about vacuum tube computers, fyi). The paper presented the first computational simulation of a liquid and did so by presenting a new Monte Carlo technique (you may have even learned about it in intro CS, but didn't give it its full name). This method was inspired by good old-fashioned physical chemistry - thinking about molecules moving around, and what determins how they move.\n",

        "The 'approximating pi' Monte Carlo example takes advantage of numpy's [random](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.rand.html) numbers that you have used a lot lately. In the original Metropolis et al. paper, they obviously couldn't do this (this was the area of Fast Computing Machines™, after all). Instead, the authors used a method known as the \"middle-square method\" for generating pseudo-random numbers. The middle-square method, typically attributed to John von Neumann, involves taking a number (the \"seed\"), squaring it, and then taking the middle digits of the result as the next number in the series, which serves as both the next seed and the \"random\" number. This method is relatively simple but suffers from some major drawbacks, which you can test out below. I also genuinely recommend reading the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-square_method) page on the middle-square method too because it pulls no punches in calling it \"highly flawed\" and also suggests that perhaps it was initially invented in the 1200s by a Franciscan friar `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`.\n",
